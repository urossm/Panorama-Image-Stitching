# Panorama Image Stitching

Panorama Image Stitching is a personal Python project that utilizes the OpenCV library to automatically stitch images together and generate panorama image. It includes features for blurring faces in the stitched panorama and generating HDR (High Dynamic Range) image.

## Usage

1. **Input Images**: Place the images you want to stitch together in the "images" folder within the project directory (there are already sample images provided for testing purposes).

2. **Run the Program**: Run the Python script provided in the project.

3. **Output**: The program will create a panorama image named "panorama.jpg" inside the project folder.

## Features

- **Automatic Stitching**: The program automatically stitches together the input images to create one wide panorama image.
  
- **Face Blurring**: Provides an option to blur faces detected in the input images after the stitching to keep privacy.

- **HDR Image Generation**: Offers the ability to generate HDR image from the stitched panorama.
